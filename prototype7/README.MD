PROTOTYPE 7
====

The game has three levels. In the first two levels, you control the square be left/right arrors. You can touch the triangles to make the sticks with the same color as the triangle rotate. You goal is to pick the ball. In the last level, instead of controlling the square, you can change the color of the ball by space. the sticks with the same color as the ball will begin to rotate. The target is still picking the ball by the square.
